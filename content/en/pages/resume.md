### IT Projects Completed
1. **Python Minecraft Farming BOT**: implemented using pyauto, time and keyboard modules. Designed
to automate the boring aspects of the game, even add some basic logic to read the logs and
understand the best time to start and stop selling items.
2. **Rendering a 3D Donut** in the terminal: created from scratch using C and concepts such as
Prospective, Light Model , Matrix Transformation. This project increased understanding of Linear
Algebra.
3. **Own Shell**: developed using C, can handle input file (batch mode), I/O redirection, background
mode and simple error handling. Forking process and file descriptor concepts have been used. Also
created a comprehensive documentation and a short user manual.
