## Descripiton 

Python Minecraft Farming BOT: implemented using pyauto, time and keyboard modules. Designed
to automate the boring aspects of the game, even add some basic logic to read the logs and
understand the best time to start and stop selling items

## Idea

It's simple, basically register all your action in codelines,
just spam hits and accumalte items, then start selling until you earn around 0$ by each click 
(get this info from the logs by using regex)

## Code & more Info

> code not updated, the regex used to grep the mony from the logs does not work
> , but can be a great start point if you want to create your own
