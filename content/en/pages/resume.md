Prospective, Light Model , Matrix Transformation. This project increased understanding of Linear
Algebra.
3. **Own Shell**: developed using C, can handle input file (batch mode), I/O redirection, background
mode and simple error handling. Forking process and file descriptor concepts have been used. Also
created a comprehensive documentation and a short user manual.
